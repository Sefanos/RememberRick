# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## What I Learned in This Project

### Project Structure

I have organized the project in a way that promotes scalability and maintainability. The folder structure is designed to separate concerns and make it easier to navigate through different parts of the application.

### Implementing APIs

I have learned how to integrate external APIs into my React application. This includes making API requests, handling responses, and updating the UI based on the retrieved data.

### Component Mounts

Understanding the component lifecycle in React is crucial. I have gained knowledge about component mounts, which includes actions that happen when a component is rendered for the first time. This knowledge has allowed me to perform necessary setup operations during component initialization.

### Fetching Data with React

I have explored different techniques for fetching data in React applications. This includes using built-in browser APIs like `fetch` as well as third-party libraries to simplify data fetching and state management.

### Deployment

I have learned how to deploy the React application to a hosting service, making it accessible to users worldwide. This involves configuring the build process, optimizing assets, and ensuring a smooth deployment workflow.
